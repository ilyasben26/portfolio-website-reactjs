# My Portfolio Website
ðŸ”´ Live website: https://ilyasben.netlify.app/
<br>
<br>
I created this portfolio using React with Typescript, Vite and Tailwind CSS.
<br>
<br>
This is my first real attempt at Front-end web development so excuse the very messy code, I followed a learn as you build approach so that explains the unoptimized component layout and styling. If I had to create a this website again, I would have done a lot of things differently given the lessons I learned.
<br>
<br>
Since I am no designer, I got inspired by this template on dribbble (https://dribbble.com/shots/22110108-Subtle-Folio-Portfolio-Framer-Template) and then simply transformed it into React code, added my own touch to it and expand it with extra functionalities like translation.
