# My Portfolio
I created this portfolio using React with Typescript and Tailwind CSS.
This is my first real attempt at Front-end development so excuse the very messy code, I followed a learn as you build approach so that explains the unoptimized component layout and styling.

Since I am no designer, I got inspired by this template () and then simply transformed it into React code, added my own touch to it and expand it with extra functionalities.
