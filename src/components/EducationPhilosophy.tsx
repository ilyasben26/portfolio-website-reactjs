                    I believe that education and learning should be a lifelong commitment,
                    much like the principle of compound interest â€” small, consistent efforts
                    lead to significant growth over time. To embody this philosophy,
                    I try to make learning a daily habit. Whether
                    through personal projects, engaging with IT-related content on YouTube, or exploring platforms like TryHackMe,
                    I continually strive to expand my knowledge and skills.
